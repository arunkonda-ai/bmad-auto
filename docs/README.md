## Quick Start Guide

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11+
- PostgreSQL 14+
- Redis 7+
- Docker & Docker Compose
- Kubernetes cluster (for production)

### Development Setup
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/bmad-auto.git
cd bmad-auto

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration

# Run database migrations
alembic upgrade head

# Start development server
python -m src.main
```

### Production Deployment
```bash
# Deploy with Docker Compose
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d

# Or deploy to Kubernetes
kubectl apply -f k8s/
```
