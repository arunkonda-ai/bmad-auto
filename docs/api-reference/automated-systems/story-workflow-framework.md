```yaml
story_id: "[unique-identifier]"
version: "v[X]"
date_created: "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ"
agents_involved: ["agent1", "agent2", ...]
phase: "[Phase description]"
status: "[DRAFT|IN_PROGRESS|QA_REVIEW|COMPLETED]"
commit_hash: "[git-commit-hash]"
provenance:
  - source: "[Origin description]"
  - context: "[Business context]"
  - priority: "[CRITICAL|HIGH|MEDIUM|LOW]"
validation:
  - technical: "[status] - [details]"
  - implementation: "[status] - [details]"
  - orchestration: "[status] - [details]"
```

## User Story
[Standard user story format]

## Story Context
[Problem statement and solution overview]

## Technical Implementation
[Implementation details and architecture]

## Agent Coordination Summary
### [Agent Name] - [Role] ‚úÖ/üîÑ/‚ùå
**Role**: [Responsibility description]
**Delivered**: [Specific deliverables]
**Quality Gate**: [Status and outcomes]
**Outcome**: [Success/failure with details]

## Definition of Done ‚úÖ

  context: "[Background and requirements]"
  success_criteria: "[Specific deliverables]"
  dependencies: "[Prerequisites or blockers]"
  timeline: "[Expected completion]"
```

### **Handoff Protocol**
```yaml
handoff:
  from: "[completing-agent]"
  to: "[next-agent]"
  deliverables: "[What was completed]"
  quality_status: "[Validation results]"

- **WAIVED**: Issues acknowledged but waived for business reasons

### **Decision Criteria Matrix**
```yaml
criteria:
  technical_implementation:
    weight: 40%
