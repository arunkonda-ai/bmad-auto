# BMAD Auto Quality Framework

## Overview

The BMAD Auto quality framework implements PM-centric quality coordination where John (PM) orchestrates validation across all 10 agents before presenting to Arun for strategic approval. Quality enforcement flows through the PM hub with selective agent involvement based on task requirements.

## PM-Centric Quality Philosophy

### PM Quality Hub Authority
- **PM Quality Coordination**: John orchestrates all quality validation across agents
- **Selective Agent Involvement**: PM determines which agents participate in quality gates
- **Context-Specific Standards**: PM defines quality requirements based on task complexity
- **Arun Strategic Approval**: Final quality approval from strategic authority

### PM-Orchestrated Quality Flow
```
Arun (Strategic Task) → PM (Quality Planning) → Agent Validation → PM (Quality Gate) → Arun (Approval)
                           ↓                        ↓                   ↓
                    Agent Selection          Context Distribution    Quality Coordination
                    Quality Standards        Task Execution         Results Validation
                    Validation Scope         Agent Reporting        Strategic Readiness
```

## PM-Orchestrated Quality Validation

### PM Quality Planning Phase
**John's Quality Coordination Responsibilities**:
- Analyze Arun's task requirements to determine quality scope
- Select relevant agents for validation based on task complexity
- Define context-specific quality standards and acceptance criteria
- Establish validation sequence and agent coordination requirements

### Agent-Specific Quality Execution

**James (Developer) - Technical Quality** (when selected by PM):
- Code quality validation within PM-defined standards
- Technical architecture compliance under Alex's guidance
- Security compliance within PM-specified requirements
- Performance validation aligned with PM quality criteria

**Quinn (QA) - Validation Quality** (when selected by PM):
- Functional testing within PM-defined scope
- Quality metrics validation against PM standards
- User acceptance criteria verification per PM requirements
- Performance benchmarking aligned with PM specifications

**Sally (UX) - Design Quality** (when selected by PM):
- User experience validation within PM-defined criteria
- Design system consistency per PM quality standards
- Accessibility compliance aligned with PM requirements
- Conversion optimization metrics delivery to PM hub

**Alex (Architect) - Infrastructure Quality** (when selected by PM):
- System architecture validation within PM scope
- Scalability verification against PM performance requirements
- Security architecture compliance per PM standards
- Infrastructure readiness assessment for PM approval

### PM Quality Gate Coordination
**John's Quality Hub Functions**:
- Aggregate validation results from selected agents
- Cross-validate quality metrics against task requirements
- Identify quality gaps requiring additional agent involvement
- Prepare comprehensive quality assessment for Arun approval

### Arun Strategic Approval
**Strategic Quality Validation** (PM-prepared assessment):
- Business objective alignment confirmed through PM coordination
- Strategic direction validation with PM impact assessment
- Resource allocation approval based on PM recommendations
- Risk assessment acceptance with PM mitigation strategies
- Market readiness confirmation through PM-coordinated validation

**PM Strategic Preparation**:
- Comprehensive quality summary from all involved agents
- Risk assessment and mitigation recommendations
- Resource impact analysis and timeline implications
- Strategic readiness confirmation with market considerations

## PM Quality Control Framework

### PM-Controlled Quality Gates
**PM Quality Selection Logic**:
- Task complexity analysis to determine required validation agents
- Quality standard definition based on strategic importance
- Validation scope limitation to essential quality criteria
- Agent coordination sequence for efficient quality validation

**Context-Specific Quality Gates**:
- Technical validation when code changes are involved (James + Quinn)
- Design validation when user experience is affected (Sally + Quinn)
- Infrastructure validation when system changes occur (Alex + Quinn)
- Comprehensive validation for strategic features (all relevant agents)

### PM-Human Quality Coordination
**PM Quality Authority**:
- Agent selection for quality validation based on task scope
- Quality standard adaptation to strategic requirements
- Cross-agent quality coordination and conflict resolution
- Quality readiness assessment before Arun presentation

**Arun Strategic Quality Authority**:
- Strategic quality standard approval and modification
- Quality trade-off decisions affecting timeline or resources
- Market quality positioning and competitive quality standards
- Quality investment decisions for long-term strategic advantage

## PM-Orchestrated Quality Recovery

### PM Quality Issue Management
**Agent-Level Issues** (PM coordination):
- PM identifies quality gaps from agent validation results
- PM assigns additional agents or re-scopes quality requirements
- PM coordinates cross-agent collaboration for quality resolution
- PM tracks quality improvement progress across agents

**Strategic Quality Issues** (Arun escalation):
- PM escalates quality decisions affecting strategic objectives
- PM presents quality trade-off options with impact analysis
- PM coordinates quality standard modifications per Arun decisions
- PM implements quality recovery plans with agent coordination

### PM Quality Iteration Control
**Quality Improvement Orchestration**:
- PM coordinates agent rework based on quality gap analysis
- PM manages quality iteration cycles with timeline considerations
- PM balances quality improvement against strategic priorities
- PM ensures quality lessons learned distribution across agents

**Learning Integration**:
- PM captures quality patterns across agent validations
- PM updates quality standards based on outcome analysis
- PM distributes quality learnings to relevant agents
- PM optimizes quality processes for future task efficiency

## PM Quality Intelligence
