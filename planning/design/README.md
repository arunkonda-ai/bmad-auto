## UX/UI Specifications

### Primary Design Documents
- **bmad-orchestration-ux-specification.md** - Complete UX specification for BMAD Auto orchestration system interfaces including PM Dashboard, Agent Activity Monitor, Human Approval Interface, and Context Intelligence Panel

## Design System Components

### User Interface Architecture
- **PM-Centric Dashboard Design** - Central command interface for orchestration oversight
- **Agent Coordination Interfaces** - Multi-agent activity monitoring and coordination
- **Human-AI Collaboration UI** - AG UI protocol implementation for strategic approvals
- **Context Intelligence Visualization** - Neural Field patterns and learning displays

### Design Principles
- Professional developer-focused aesthetic with "mission control" theme
- Data-rich interfaces conveying system intelligence and reliability
- Clear visual hierarchy for complex agent coordination displays
- WCAG AA accessibility compliance
- Responsive web design for desktop, laptop, and tablet access

### Integration Points
- CLI interface compatibility for developer workflows
- Real-time WebSocket integration for collaboration interfaces
- Human oversight dashboard with approval workflow UX
- System health monitoring with clear visual indicators

All design planning documents support the PM-centric orchestration architecture with emphasis on human strategic oversight and autonomous operational excellence.
