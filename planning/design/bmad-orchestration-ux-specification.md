- **Spatial Continuity**: Animations maintain spatial relationships in complex agent coordination views
- **Performance Awareness**: Smooth 60fps performance even with multiple real-time agent updates
- **Accessibility First**: Reduced motion support with alternate feedback mechanisms

### Key Animations

- **Agent Status Transitions:** Smooth color/icon morphing when agents change states (Duration: 300ms, Easing: ease-out)
- **Strategic Approval Cascade:** Gentle highlighting flow showing approval impact through agent network (Duration: 800ms, Easing: cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1))
- **Real-time Data Updates:** Subtle pulse/glow effects for new information without disrupting focus (Duration: 200ms, Easing: ease-in-out)
- **Agent Coordination Flow:** Animated pathways showing task handoffs between agents (Duration: 1200ms, Easing: ease-in-out)
- **Strategic Decision Feedback:** Satisfying confirmation animation for critical approvals (Duration: 500ms, Easing: spring(1, 100, 10))
- **System Health Pulse:** Gentle breathing animation for overall system status indicator (Duration: 2000ms, Easing: sine wave)
- **Workflow Timeline Progress:** Smooth progress indicators showing autonomous development advancement (Duration: 400ms, Easing: ease-out)
- **Emergency Alert Escalation:** Attention-grabbing but not jarring animation for critical issues (Duration: 600ms, Easing: ease-in-out, with pause intervals)

## Performance Considerations

### Performance Goals

- **Page Load:** Sub-2 second initial dashboard load, sub-1 second for cached strategic views
- **Interaction Response:** Sub-100ms response for all strategic decision controls, sub-200ms for complex agent coordination actions
- **Animation FPS:** Consistent 60fps for all motion design, graceful degradation to 30fps under heavy agent activity

### Design Strategies

**Real-time Data Optimization:** Intelligent data streaming with priority-based updates (strategic approvals > agent status > performance metrics), WebSocket connections with automatic reconnection, smart batching of non-critical updates to prevent interface flooding.

**Progressive Loading:** Strategic information loads first (approval queue, critical alerts), followed by agent coordination details, then historical analytics. Skeleton screens maintain spatial layout during loading phases.

**Interaction Responsiveness:** Optimistic UI updates for strategic decisions with rollback capability, immediate visual feedback for all controls, intelligent preloading of likely next actions based on workflow patterns.

**Resource Management:** Lazy loading of complex visualizations, efficient memory management for real-time agent network displays, automatic cleanup of historical data beyond strategic relevance timeframes.
