### Goals

The primary vision for BMAD Auto is to **develop world-class AI applications and products** using a coordinated 10-agent team. Here are the strategic objectives in priority order:

• **Goal 1 - Complete .bmad-core Preservation**: Maintain 100% compatibility with existing .bmad-core foundation (agents, tasks, checklists, workflows, templates) while adding autonomous orchestration capabilities - this is our foundational requirement

• **Goal 2 - World-Class Product Development Capability**: Enable development of enterprise-grade AI applications and products through coordinated 10-agent autonomous team with PM orchestration managing complete product lifecycles from Research → Ideation → PRD → Architecture → MVP → Scale

• **Goal 3 - PM-Centric Agent Orchestration**: Deploy existing .bmad-core agents organized as Tier 1 Core Agents (John-PM, Alex-Architect, James-Dev, Quinn-QA, Sally-UX, Mary-Analyst), Tier 2 Coordination Agents (Product Owner, Scrum Master, BMAD Master), and Tier 3 Orchestration Agents (BMAD Orchestrator) with John (PM) coordinating all agent activities and task assignments

• **Goal 4 - BMAD Core Weaponization**: Enable all agents to leverage .bmad-core commands, checklists, workflows, tasks, and templates as their primary operational tools with seamless integration and execution capabilities

• **Goal 5 - Production-Grade Integration (MVP Scope)**: Enable real external service integration with GitHub CLI + API fallback, Linear API + internal dashboard hybrid, multi-provider AI models (Anthropic Claude + Z.ai GLM with intelligent switching), AG-UI interface for human-AI collaboration, Agent-specific MCP access (Playwright MCP for QA/Dev agents), LangGraph/LangFuse localhost orchestration, and PostgreSQL + coordination.db hybrid database architecture

• **Goal 6 - Strategic Human-AI Collaboration**: Establish quality gates, escalation protocols, and strategic oversight points while maintaining autonomous operation for routine tasks with clear intervention capabilities

• **Goal 7 - System Extensibility**: Provide ability to extend the system with new agents, tasks, workflows, and capabilities using the same .bmad-core format and patterns for seamless growth and adaptation

• **Goal 13 - Context Engineering Cognitive Framework**: [DEFERRED TO POST-MVP] Implement advanced Atom/Molecule/Cell cognitive primitives with vector embedding infrastructure and cross-agent learning capabilities for sophisticated autonomous operations

### Background Context

BMAD Auto represents the evolution of the successful `.bmad-core` methodology into a complete autonomous product development orchestration system. The extensive research has identified the opportunity to create the industry's first comprehensive AI-powered platform that can manage entire product lifecycles autonomously while preserving the proven BMAD patterns.

Current market solutions provide point solutions (single agent assistance, simple automation) but lack the comprehensive orchestration needed for complete product development. Bmad-Auto fills this gap by combining Fabric-inspired modularity, proven SDLC methodologies, and systematic human-AI collaboration to deliver world-class autonomous product development capabilities.

The system builds upon the solid foundation of `.bmad-core` with its proven agents, tasks, templates, and workflows while adding the orchestration layer that enables true autonomous product development from market research through production deployment. The implementation follows a budget-conscious approach, initially optimized for efficient operation within constrained compute resources, with a clear scaling path as the system proves its value through successful product development outcomes.

**Task Assignment Pattern**:
```yaml
pm_task_assignment:
  task_context:
    - task_description
    - acceptance_criteria
    - dependencies
    - timeline_constraints

  provided_resources:
    - relevant_bmad_core_templates
    - applicable_workflow_steps

    - escalation_protocols
```

**Autonomous Agent Decision Making**:
- Agents receive task context and provisioned resources
- Agents autonomously select appropriate .bmad-core commands
- Agents execute workflows based on task requirements
- Agents escalate when decisions exceed autonomous capabilities

### Complete .bmad-core Integration

#### Command Accessibility

All .bmad-core resources are fully accessible within BMAD Auto workflows:

**Templates**: All templates (prd-tmpl.yaml, architecture-tmpl.yaml, etc.)
**Checklists**: All validation checklists (pm-checklist.md, qa-checklist.md, etc.)
**Workflows**: All existing workflows (greenfield-fullstack.yaml, etc.)
**Tasks**: All task definitions (create-doc.md, execute-checklist.md, etc.)

#### Extension Integration Pattern

```yaml
# Example: Enhanced PM workflow with .bmad-core integration
workflow_step:
  agent: pm
  task: create_comprehensive_prd
  bmad_auto_enhancements:
    - autonomous_task_breakdown
    - spec_kit_integration
    - cross_agent_coordination
  bmad_core_resources:
    - templates/prd-tmpl.yaml

  autonomous_execution:
    - select_appropriate_template
    - execute_creation_workflow
    - apply_quality_checkpoints
    - escalate_complex_decisions
```

### Quality Gates and Coordination

#### Cross-Workflow Quality Gates

**Specification → Architecture Gate**
- PM validates specification completeness
- Architect validates technical feasibility
- All .bmad-core validation checklists executed

**Architecture → Development Gate**
- PM approves implementation approach
- Developer validates task breakdown clarity
- QA validates testability requirements

**Development → Validation Gate**
- QA validates implementation completeness
- PM validates requirement fulfillment

#### PM Coordination Protocols

John (PM) maintains oversight through structured coordination:

**Workflow Orchestration**
- Autonomous workflow selection based on project type
- Cross-agent task assignment with context provisioning
- Quality gate management with escalation protocols
- Resource optimization and timeline management

**Agent Coordination**
- Task breakdown and agent assignment
- Progress monitoring and bottleneck resolution
- Quality validation and approval workflows
