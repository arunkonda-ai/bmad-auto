# Testing Strategy Architecture Review - Session Handoff

## Session Objective
Continue section-by-section architecture review and verification, focusing on **Testing Strategy** section from the comprehensive planning document.

## Session Context
Following completion of Infrastructure and Deployment Integration review with updates including:

### âœ… **Completed Updates:**
- **Framework Name**: Confirmed as "Bmad-Auto"
- **Database Strategy**: PostgreSQL primary + SQLite coordination.db preserved
- **AI Restriction**: Claude Code agents only for MVP
- **OS Support**: macOS, Windows, Linux (OS agnostic)
- **AI Models**: Anthropic Claude + GLM models supported
- **Autonomous Package Architecture**: Clear transition strategy defined
- **PRD Updates**: Context Engineering deferred to post-MVP, naming updated to Bmad-Auto

### **Current Architecture Sections Status:**
- âœ… **Source Tree Organization** (reviewed, deferred to last)
- âœ… **Infrastructure and Deployment Integration** (completed with updates)
- ðŸ”„ **Testing Strategy** (NEXT - for this session)
- ðŸ“‹ **Security Integration** (pending)
- ðŸ“‹ **Additional sections** (if any)

## Key Architecture Principles Established
1. **Bmad-Auto Framework** (not BMAD framework due to trademark)
2. **PostgreSQL Primary** with SQLite coordination.db preservation
3. **Claude Code Only** for MVP (other AI agents post-package success)
4. **Autonomous Package Design** (transform from development loop to installable)
5. **BMAD Core Integration** as installed dependency (trademarked repo)
6. **Three-Phase Transition**: Development â†’ Packaging â†’ Autonomous Operation

## Testing Strategy Focus Areas

### **Critical Questions for Review:**
1. **Testing Framework Alignment**: How does testing support the autonomous package architecture?
2. **Claude Code Testing**: Specific testing patterns for Claude Code agent interactions?
3. **PostgreSQL Testing**: Database testing strategy for both PostgreSQL and SQLite?
4. **Cross-Platform Testing**: Testing approach for macOS, Windows, Linux support?
5. **Package Testing**: How do we test the installable package vs development environment?
6. **Integration Testing**: Testing external services (GitHub, Linear, AG-UI, MCP tools)?

### **Expected Deliverables:**
- Review Testing Strategy section comprehensively
- Identify any gaps or updates needed for autonomous package design
- Ensure testing aligns with PostgreSQL primary + SQLite preservation
- Validate Claude Code agent testing approaches
- Update testing strategy if needed based on infrastructure decisions

## Reference Documents
- **Main Planning Document**: `.bmad-auto/planning/planning-sessions/session-2025-09-27-alex-human-spec-kit-architecture-coordination.md`
- **Updated PRD**: `.bmad-auto/planning/requirements/prd.md`
- **Claude Code Best Practices**: `.bmad-auto/docs/05-best-practices/claude-code-best-practices.md`

## Session Instructions
1. **Present Testing Strategy section** from planning document for human verification
2. **Human-guided updates**: Work with human to identify and make necessary changes to the planning document
3. **Update testing approach** in planning document based on autonomous package architecture decisions
4. **Human verification and approval** of all changes before proceeding (like this session's approach)
5. **Update planning document** with any changes discussed and approved
6. **Prepare for Security Integration** section review next

**Approach**: Follow same pattern as Infrastructure session - present section, discuss with human, get approval, update planning document with human-guided changes.

**Ready to begin Testing Strategy architecture review and updates.**
