# PRD-Architecture Alignment Analysis Report

**Analysis Date**: 2025-09-27
**Analyst**: Winston (Architect)
**Source Documents**:
- PRD: `.bmad-auto/planning/requirements/prd.md`
- Architecture: `.bmad-auto/planning/architecture/bmad-auto-comprehensive-technical-architecture.md`

## Executive Summary

The comprehensive architecture document successfully addresses the majority of PRD requirements with strong alignment on core objectives. However, there are **5 critical conflicts** and **8 significant gaps** that require PRD updates to ensure implementation success and Spec Kit compatibility.

**Alignment Score**: 78% (Good alignment with identified resolution paths)

**Critical Issues Requiring PRD Updates**:
1. **Database Strategy Conflict**: PRD assumes PostgreSQL primary, architecture implements PostgreSQL + SQLite hybrid
2. **Model Provider Strategy Gap**: PRD underspecifies multi-provider optimization approach
3. **External Service Integration Gap**: PRD lacks details on CLI-first approach and fallback mechanisms
4. **LangGraph Orchestration Gap**: PRD doesn't adequately specify LangGraph workflow requirements
5. **PM Decision Reasoning Framework Missing**: Architecture implements comprehensive PM cognitive framework not specified in PRD
