    title: Intro Project Analysis and Context
    instruction: |
      IMPORTANT - SCOPE ASSESSMENT REQUIRED:

      This PRD is for SIGNIFICANT enhancements to existing BMAD Auto project that require comprehensive planning and multiple stories. Before proceeding:

      1. **Assess Enhancement Complexity**: If this is a simple feature addition or bug fix that could be completed in 1-2 focused development sessions, STOP and recommend: "For simpler changes, consider using the brownfield-create-epic or brownfield-create-story task with the Product Owner instead. This full PRD process is designed for substantial enhancements that require architectural planning and multiple coordinated stories."

      2. **Project Context**: Determine if we're working in an IDE with the project already loaded or if the user needs to provide project information. If project files are available, analyze existing documentation in the docs folder. If insufficient documentation exists, recommend running the document-project task first.

      3. **Deep Assessment Requirement**: You MUST thoroughly analyze the existing BMAD Auto project structure, patterns, and constraints before making ANY suggestions. Every recommendation must be grounded in actual project analysis, not assumptions.

      Gather comprehensive information about the existing BMAD Auto project. This section must be completed before proceeding with requirements.

      CRITICAL: Throughout this analysis, explicitly confirm your understanding with the user. For every assumption you make about the existing project, ask: "Based on my analysis, I understand that [assumption]. Is this correct?"

      Do not proceed with any recommendations until the user has validated your understanding of the existing system.

      CRITICAL STORY SEQUENCING FOR BMAD AUTO BROWNFIELD:
      - Stories must ensure existing PM Hub and agent ecosystem functionality remains intact
      - Each story should include verification that existing workflows still work
      - Stories should be sequenced to minimize risk to existing system
      - Include rollback considerations for each story
      - Focus on incremental integration rather than big-bang changes
      - Size stories for AI agent execution in existing BMAD Auto codebase context
      - MANDATORY: Present the complete story sequence and ask: "This story sequence is designed to minimize risk to your existing BMAD Auto system. Does this order make sense given your project's architecture and constraints?"
      - Stories must be logically sequential with clear dependencies identified
      - Each story must deliver value while maintaining system integrity
      - Stories must respect .bmad-core preservation requirements
