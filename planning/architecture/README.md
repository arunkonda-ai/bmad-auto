# Architecture Planning

## Technical Architecture Documents

### System Architecture
- **bmad-auto-technical-architecture.md** - Complete technical architecture for BMAD Auto orchestration system including infrastructure design, component architecture, and integration patterns

## Architecture Planning Organization

### Planning vs. Reference
- **Planning Architecture** (here): Forward-looking design documents that inform implementation decisions
- **Reference Architecture** (docs/): Finalized documentation of implemented system components

### Architecture Components
- **System Design**: Overall architecture patterns and component relationships
- **Infrastructure Planning**: Database, API, and service architecture decisions
- **Integration Architecture**: External service integration patterns and protocols
- **Security Architecture**: Authentication, authorization, and data protection design

### Implementation Guidance
All architecture planning documents provide specific technical guidance for:
- Component implementation patterns
- Database schema design
- API contract specifications
- Integration protocol selection
- Performance and scalability considerations

Architecture planning supports the PM-centric orchestration system with emphasis on .bmad-core preservation and systematic implementation phases.
