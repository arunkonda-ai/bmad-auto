# ðŸš€ BMAD Auto: Domain-Specific Implementation Context

*Specialized context for BMAD Auto autonomous orchestration system development*

---

## ðŸŽ¯ BMAD AUTO DOMAIN FOCUS

### Implementation Status
- **Current Phase**: Spec Kit conversion with resolved conflicts
- **Architecture**: Multi-provider AI (Claude + Z.ai GLM) with LangGraph orchestration
- **Database Strategy**: PostgreSQL primary + coordination.db extension
- **External Integration**: GitHub CLI + Linear API (MVP scope)

### Resolved Architecture Conflicts
1. âœ… **AI Model Strategy**: Multi-provider approach confirmed
2. âœ… **Database Architecture**: Hybrid PostgreSQL + coordination.db
3. âœ… **Integration Scope**: MVP-focused external services
4. âœ… **Context Engineering**: Deferred to post-MVP as planned
