# Tasks: Foundation & PM Orchestration Hub

**Input**: Design documents from `.bmad-auto/specs/001-foundation-pm-orchestration/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md ✅, research.md ✅, data-model.md ✅, contracts/ ✅, quickstart.md ✅

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory ✅
   → Tech stack: LangGraph, PostgreSQL, Claude Code, FastAPI
   → Structure: Extension overlay preserving .bmad-core
2. Load design documents ✅:
   → data-model.md: 6 core entities (PMDecisionContext, AgentState, etc.)
   → contracts/: PM orchestration API with 12 endpoints
   → research.md: Multi-provider AI decisions and patterns
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: Database, LangGraph, environment configuration
   → Tests: Contract tests for PM API, entity validation tests
   → Core: PM orchestration logic, agent extension system
   → Integration: Claude Code terminal, external service coordination
   → Polish: Performance optimization, monitoring, documentation
4. Apply task rules:
   → Different files = mark [P] for parallel execution
   → Same file = sequential (no [P] marking)
   → Tests before implementation (TDD approach)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...)
6. Generate dependency graph and parallel execution examples
7. Validate task completeness for production-ready system
