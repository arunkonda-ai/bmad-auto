## ⚡ Quick Guidelines
- ✅ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ❌ Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- 👥 Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a Product Manager coordinating autonomous AI agent teams, I need a central orchestration hub that can intelligently manage multiple AI agents across different providers, maintain persistent workflow state, and provide intelligent decision support while preserving existing BMAD-core capabilities. The system must optimize costs through intelligent model assignment while providing real-time visibility into agent coordination and quality gate management.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a new product development task, **When** I assign it to the PM orchestration hub, **Then** the system autonomously breaks down the task into subtasks, assigns appropriate agents based on capabilities, selects optimal AI models based on task complexity, and provides me with a timeline and resource estimation.

2. **Given** multiple agents working on coordinated tasks, **When** I monitor the orchestration dashboard, **Then** I can see real-time agent status, current task progress, resource utilization across AI providers, and any quality gate approvals pending my review.

3. **Given** a system restart or interruption, **When** the orchestration hub restarts, **Then** all agent states, workflow progress, and decision context are restored within 30 seconds, allowing seamless continuation of all active tasks.

4. **Given** budget constraints for AI model usage, **When** the system assigns tasks to agents, **Then** it automatically selects cost-effective models for routine tasks while reserving premium models for complex reasoning, providing cost projections and optimization recommendations.

5. **Given** a quality gate requiring my approval, **When** I review agent output, **Then** I can see complete decision context, reasoning trails, cross-agent validation results, and approve/reject with documented rationale that feeds back into system learning.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when an agent becomes unresponsive during task execution?
- How does the system handle AI provider service outages or rate limiting?
- What occurs when database connectivity is lost during workflow execution?
- How does the system manage conflicting decisions between agents?
- What happens when budget limits are approached or exceeded?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*
